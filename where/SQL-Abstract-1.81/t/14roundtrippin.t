# FIXME FIXME FIXME
# The formatter/unparser accumulated a ton of technical debt,
# and I don't have time to fix it all :( Some of the problems:
# - format() does an implicit parenthesis unroll for prettyness
#   which makes it hard to do exact comparisons
# - there is no space preservation framework (also makes comparisons
#   problematic)
# - there is no operator case preservation framework either
#
# So what we do instead is resort to some monkey patching and
# lowercasing and stuff to get something we can compare to the
# original SQL string
# Ugly but somewhat effective
